### Roadmap

The first release of the project system ("15.0") was heavily focused on supporting .NET Core scenarios and parity with [VS 2015 project.json tooling](https://github.com/dotnet/project-system/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3AParity-XProj%20). This will continue through the Visual Studio 15.x.x updates and releases. In 16.x, we'll start focusing on [feature parity](https://github.com/dotnet/project-system/labels/Parity-Legacy-Feature) with the legacy project system and support for .NET Core 3.0.
